# DihChain - PayStream Vault
[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/AryaMundra/DihChain)

DihChain is a decentralized payroll management system designed to run on the HeLa blockchain. It enables organizations to stream salaries to employees in real-time using the native HLUSD currency. The project consists of a `PayStreamVault` smart contract for the core logic and a feature-rich React dashboard for seamless interaction.

The system provides dedicated interfaces for both administrators (HR) and employees, simplifying on-chain payroll management, treasury funding, and salary withdrawals.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Salary Streaming:** Salaries accrue per second and can be withdrawn by employees at any time.
*   **Automated Tax Handling:** A configurable percentage of each withdrawal is automatically sent to a designated tax vault.
*   **Vesting & Cliff Periods:** Set contract durations and initial cliff periods for new employee streams.
*   **Dual-Role Dashboard:** A single application with distinct views and functionalities for HR administrators and employees.
*   **Comprehensive Admin Controls:**
    *   Fund the main treasury.
    *   Create, pause, and cancel salary streams.
    *   Pay instant, one-time bonuses.
    *   Perform emergency withdrawals to the owner's wallet.
    *   Update the designated tax vault address.
*   **Secure & On-Demand Withdrawals:** Employees can view their accrued salary and withdraw available funds with a single transaction.

## Components

The repository is organized into two main components:

### 1. Smart Contract (`smart_contract/`)

The core of the system is the `PayStreamVault.sol` contract, built with Solidity and OpenZeppelin libraries.

*   **`Ownable` & `ReentrancyGuard`:** Ensures secure, single-owner administration and protects against re-entrancy attacks.
*   **Stream Management:** Provides functions for administrators to `startStream`, `pauseStream`, and `cancelStream` for any employee address.
*   **Salary & Tax Logic:** Calculates salary per second based on a monthly figure and automatically deducts a specified `taxPercent` during withdrawals.
*   **Treasury Functions:** Includes mechanisms for the owner to `depositTreasury`, view the `treasuryBalance`, and perform an `emergencyWithdraw`.

### 2. PayStream Dashboard (`paystream-dashboard/`)

A modern, responsive frontend built with React, Vite, and Material-UI to interact with the smart contract. It provides a user-friendly interface for all parties.

*   **Admin View:**
    *   **Dashboard:** Displays high-level statistics like total active streams, current treasury balance, and total accrued liability.
    *   **Stream Management:** A dedicated page to create new salary streams with parameters for monthly salary, tax percentage, duration, and cliff period. Also allows for pausing and canceling existing streams.
    *   **Admin Panel:** Provides tools for treasury management (deposits), bonus payments, and critical configuration changes like updating the tax vault.

*   **Employee View:**
    *   A personalized portal where employees can connect their wallet to view their active stream details, including monthly salary, tax rate, and contract timings.
    *   Displays the real-time accrued salary available for withdrawal.
    *   Allows employees to execute a withdrawal transaction directly from the interface.

## Getting Started

To run the PayStream Dashboard locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   A package manager like `npm` or `yarn`
*   A Web3 wallet extension like MetaMask

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AryaMundra/DihChain.git
    cd DihChain
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the dashboard directory:**
    ```bash
    cd paystream-dashboard
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

5.  **Configure MetaMask:**
    *   To interact with the application, you must connect to the HeLa Chain. Add a new network with the following details:
        *   **Network Name:** HeLa Testnet
        *   **RPC URL:** `https://testnet-rpc.helachain.com`
        *   **Chain ID:** `666888`
        *   **Currency Symbol:** `HLUSD`
    *   Switch to the HeLa Testnet network in MetaMask.
